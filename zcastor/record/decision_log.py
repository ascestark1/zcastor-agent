"""
Daily decision log — the refusal record.

The system declines most of what it sees. Under the accountability thesis that is
the interesting behaviour, not the boring part: anyone can show you their fills.
Showing every signal you refused, with the reason and the policy in force, is the
claim that is actually hard to fake.

Why a daily digest rather than one record per refusal: volume. Anchoring is cheap
but not free, and a system built to say no would write thousands of records to
say it. One dossier per session, listing every decision in order, keeps the full
detail and makes the audit one lookup instead of a thousand. Revisit if a
counterparty ever asks for finer grain — the entries are per-decision either way,
only the anchoring is batched.

Executed trades still get their own dossier. This log is the complete decision
set including them, so the two views reconcile: every entry here with
`action: allow` has a matching trade dossier.
