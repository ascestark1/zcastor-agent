Publishing — where a dossier actually goes.

Without this the record layer computes a checksum, anchors it, and the artifact
exists nowhere. A counterparty gets a hash with nothing to hash. This is the
piece that turns a `uri` field into a real document.

Layout — every path is CONTENT-ADDRESSED and never overwritten:

    dossiers/
    ├── trades/2026-08-27/sig_8d66ac748b02.1da0ae2c.json
    ├── decisions/2026-08-27.7e16e4d9.json
    ├── policy/sha256-0ea50bc8.json
    └── manifest.json

The checksum prefix in each filename is not decoration. Without it a path is
mutable, and a mutable path breaks verification in a way that cannot be
distinguished from tampering: republish a session and the bytes at an
already-anchored URL change, so an auditor fetching it computes a different
hash. Raw file hosting adds CDN caching on top, so they may not even be
fetching the current version. Failed verification then means "stale, republished
or tampered with" and there is no way to tell which.

With the checksum in the path, a URL resolves to exactly one byte sequence
forever. A republished session is a NEW file and a NEW record, and the previous
record is marked Superseded rather than silently replaced.

`manifest.json` is a mutable convenience index mapping each day to the
checksums published for it, newest last. Nothing is anchored against it and no
verification depends on it — it exists so a human can find the current version
without listing a directory.

The rule from `canonical.py` holds throughout: the bytes written here are the
bytes hashed. An auditor runs `sha256sum` on what they downloaded and gets the
value on chain, with no knowledge of our serialiser.

Visibility
----------
Two postures, chosen per publisher instance:

**public** — the document is world-readable and `uri` resolves for anyone. This
is the right mode for our own book, where open verification IS the product, and
it is what makes an audit possible with no involvement from us.

**private** — the document stays on our infrastructure and `uri` carries a
non-resolvable identifier. The checksum still anchors, so the record is still
permanent, attributable and timestamped; it simply cannot be read by the world.
Disclosure to a named counterparty is a deliberate act (see `disclosure.py`),
and they verify exactly as a public reader would.

Private is the default for client mandates. A decision log is a fairly direct
description of a strategy: the refusals say what a desk will not trade and
under what conditions, which is precisely the part a client is paying to keep.
Publishing that openly would be a confidentiality failure dressed up as
transparency.

This mirrors NVNM's own framing — the proof goes on chain, the data stays home —
and the primitive supports both without change, because what is anchored is a
checksum and a URI, not the document.

The PUBLIC root is intended to be a separate repo from the code. The code repo
holds credentials in `.env` and must stay private; a public dossier repo holds
only published claims and must be world-readable or the audit path breaks.
