"""
Market data port.

Two classes, and the split is deliberate:

  MarketData   — reads. Ticks, balance, margin, positions, deal history.
  OrderPlacer  — writes. Orders, closes, cancellations.

Gates are handed a `MarketData` and nothing else. A gate therefore *cannot*
place an order, because the object it holds has no method to do so. In v1 the
zone gate closed positions inline; that was possible because everything shared
one connector. This is the same rule enforced structurally instead of by comment.

Per-decision caching
--------------------
v1 called `account_info()` separately in the drawdown gate and again in the
viability gate, and `get_open_positions()` twice more — four round trips over
rpyc for one signal, each returning a slightly different instant. `begin()`
starts a decision and clears the cache; within one decision, balance is read
once and every gate sees the same number.

That is not only faster, it is more correct: Proof of State claims the decision
was made under specific conditions, and it should be one set of conditions.

Credentials come from the environment. `config.json` in v1 held the MT5 password
in plaintext and was committed; nothing in v2 reads secrets from a tracked file.
