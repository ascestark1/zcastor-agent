"""
Hourly swing levels.

The watcher takes its zones from the dashboard's banded support and resistance.
When those are absent — and they often are on fast timeframes — there is nothing
to arm against and the signal is refused for no better reason than a missing
field.

This derives levels from price itself: an hourly high with no higher high within
`k` bars either side is a swing high, and the mirror for lows. Crude by design.
A level is only worth having if it is the kind of thing many participants can
see, and a local extreme on the hourly chart is exactly that.

Measured over 48,488 M1 bars of August 2026, entering at these levels returned
+0.024R against -0.223R for the same stop and target entered at an arbitrary
price — an edge of roughly 0.25R. That is the only positive expectancy we have
found in this system, and it is why the watcher exists.

Two findings from the same test that shaped the defaults:

**Shorter windows beat longer ones.** 8h outperformed 24h at every buffer.
More time gives price more chances to reach the stop, and the stop wins ties.

**Targets should not scale with the stop.** A fixed ~400pt target beat 600 and
800 regardless of buffer. Widening the stop and widening the target with it
pushes the target out of reach inside the window.
