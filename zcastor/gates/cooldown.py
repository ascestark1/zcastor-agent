"""
Entry cooldown.

Two signals arriving close together on one instrument are not two trades. They
are one trade at double size, with the correlation hidden from every risk check
that looks at position count rather than exposure.

This happened. On 31 August two orders filled in the same second at 77948.55 and
77941.25, then two more a minute apart at 77861 and 77867. Four entries on
essentially one setup, and they cost 16.53 of a 51.46 total loss — a third of it,
from a defect rather than from being wrong about direction.

The stack limit did not catch it because five positions were permitted and only
four were open. Position count is the wrong measure: five entries at the same
price in the same minute is one position at five times the size, and no gate in
the stack was asking about that.

So: after a fill, refuse further market entries for a cooldown period. The
watcher is exempt — an armed entry has already waited for its level and its
fill is the confirmation, not an impulse.
