"""
Gate primitives for Zcastor v2.

The single rule this module exists to enforce: a gate is a pure function from
context to verdict. It never mutates a shared suppression flag, and it never
decides whether it should run — the pipeline decides that from the gate's own
declared properties.

That is what makes the v1 route-guard bug inexpressible. In v1, "routed signals
skip the range gates" was a comment plus an `and not route_to_watcher` clause
repeated by hand at each call site; when the block was split into three
statements, two copies of the guard were lost silently. Here, a gate declares
`runs_when_routed = False` once, and the pipeline honours it for every gate.
