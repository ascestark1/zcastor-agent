"""
NVNM Chain anchoring backend.

STILL NEVER EXECUTED AGAINST THE CHAIN. What changed is that the untestable part
is now one small class instead of the whole module.

Everything that encodes a decision — which arguments go where, how metadata is
serialised, which failures are transient — is testable against a fake transport.
`Web3Transport` is the only piece that needs a node, and it is deliberately thin
enough to read in one sitting. When the first real transaction lands, that is
where the surprises will be.

No custom contract. The chain's anchoring module is a precompile at 0x…0A00 and
provides registries, checksummed records, versioning, status and role-based
access. `NvnmReceipts.sol` and the three Xenea-era contracts are archived.

The key never leaves the process. There is no gateway in the write path, so
custody does not change.
