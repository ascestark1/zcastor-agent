"""
What landed where.

The outbox knows what still needs sending; nothing knew what had already been
sent. That gap blocks the status lifecycle: to move a dossier from `committed` to
`resolved` you need the record ID the chain gave back, and by the time the
outcome arrives — hours later, possibly after a restart — that value is gone.

So: an append-only index of anchored records, keyed by signal ID.

This is also what makes the ordering guarantee demonstrable rather than merely
designed. A record anchored `committed` at decision time and moved to `resolved`
afterwards proves the prediction preceded the outcome, and the chain versions the
change instead of rewriting it. Without the index, every dossier would sit at
`committed` forever and the distinction would be invisible.

Append-only for the same reason as the outbox and the journal: a rewritten file
is one bad shutdown away from losing the lot.
